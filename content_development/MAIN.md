# Module 9: Open Educational Resources

## Rationale 
Open Educational Resources (OERs) are freely accessible, openly licensed materials for teaching and learning, and represent a paradigm shift compared to traditional methods of education. They are intrinsically related to developments in Open Science, due to the wider implications of access to knowledge in education in our global societies. This module will provide an understanding of the motivations behind OERs and how to develop your own. Learning outcomes
- The researcher will be able to convey the motivations behind the OER movement, and the relationship that this has with Open Science.
- The researcher will be able to identify and implement the steps to either prepare content for educational re-use purposes, or be able to design their own OER.
- The researcher will be able to either identify relevant places where their research can be integrated into Wikipedia, or integrate it themselves if they are a user.
